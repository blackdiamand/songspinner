## Songs to fit the mood

Type how you are feeling, and get songs to fit the mood. We use sentiment analysis to analyze the text of the word, and the Spotify API to retrieve songs.

## Running:

Install [google-cloud-language](https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-language/) on pip.


Put your [Spotify clientID and secret](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) in apikey.txt

Run with `python3 -m http.server --bind localhost --cgi 8000` and head to localhost:8000
